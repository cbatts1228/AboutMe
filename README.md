## Summary

My name is Caden Batts, I'm a senior in high school. I enjoy learning about the software side of Computers, I plan on going to USI to study Computer Science and then eventually finding a career that lets me work with software. I'm a very outgoing person so I enjoy meeting new people and making new friends. I'm hoping that I'll get to work on projects with other people in college and when I start working.
